# AR test

---

I've been meaning to get around to trying out AR for a while. The first snowday of Spring finally gave me that opportunity. 

I followed a tutorial that I found on [Medium by Francesco Pallota](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-an-augmented-reality-app-using-arkit-and-unity-ba16515a32fa), and it was fairly straightforward. Fortunately, I have some experience with Unity and XCode, but even if you have never used these programs before, it's still fairly easy. Here are some images.

There are some bugs with AR Kit's depth detection, and I anticipate that I'll learn how to mitigate it as I continue to explore the technology.
