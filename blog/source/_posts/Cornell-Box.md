Aunt Dan and Lemon are about how we justify evil to ourselves. We have an innate ability to dehumanize others in order to rationalize the terrible things we are capable of doing to one another. 

In order to express this, I created a Cornell Box that shows cockroaches performing a quotidian human scene. 

In the play, Lemon expresses how humans are inherently programmed to kill, and we do not feel bad about it. To defend her view, she describes how humans are capable of killing cockroaches without any sense of disgust or regret. This rationale, in a sense, justifies our evil deeds, and so we as humans should thank those who partake in the unpleasant acts for us. 

I disagree with this view. I think the premise is wrong. Reducing humans to anything subhuman is illogical and wrong. The sheer act of doing so in order to justify our acts is the cause of a lot of our problems. Sure we can do this, but it doesn't mean we have to or we should.
