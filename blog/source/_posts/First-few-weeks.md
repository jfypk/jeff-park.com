## The final year has begun

ITP started this week! I've only sat in three classes so far, but I can already tell that I'm going to miss this place a lot. I'm on the waitlist for so many classes that I know that I won't get to take and the FOMO is real. 

Marina's Temporary Experts class seems like a great class on systems thinking and taking a research-based approach to your art practice. And unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to take it. I've also heard great things about her as a professor, and word on the street is that she may be leaving for another NYU campus sometime soon. Ugh. 

## Heavy potential 

It's literally only been two days, and I've already learned some things that I feel are going to change the game for me. I sat in Designing for Live Performance, and Andrew Lazarow shared the approach to the creative process for performance pieces. It was tremendously useful information: Elanor Fuchs, Aristotle's story arcs, Nine Rasas, Mary Overlie's 6 viewpoints, and the Laban Movement. Incredible stuff that will have an influential impact on my Big Screens and NIME classes. 

Though I probably won't be in Marina's class, I read through her lecture notes, and there's a lot of great resources in there regarding solving wicked problems(!), systemic thinking, epistemologies, etc. Both of these classes really hone in on the different aspects that make up a strong creative project. Strong creative projects have good tie-ins with their project kinships, contexts, its media/material, and the audience/participants. It might be art school 101 stuff, but it's stuff that I never learned. And although it'd be better to strengthen my art practice with both of these courses, I think I will do OK with just Andrew's class. I'll occasionally peek into Marina's slides and try to syphon off as much knowledge as I can. 

Man this is going to be a great year.
