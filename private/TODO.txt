Round 2
- Update scrolling values
- on hover of portfolio pieces in /work, fill page with main image of project
- Build three.js sketch for homepage. 
- fix hover color. Links should be white until they are hovered over. 

Nice to have
- fix the scroll of my page when minimized
- add questions to my page (possibly in header of portfolio and at bottom scroll)
- Build mosaic of my face for /about


Each section on a portfolio page should have a max width of 750. But each section should also be equal length...
