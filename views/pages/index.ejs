        <div id="home-intro">
            <p>I am a multidisciplinary problem-solver based in NYC. <a href="/">Code</a>, <a href="/">3D</a>, and physical prototypes are my tools of choice. I have worked for <a href="https://www.atlassian.com">Atlassian</a>, the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/index.page">NYC Mayor's Office of Economic Opportunity</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nyu-x.org/">NYU-X Innovation Lab</a>. Right now, I am interested in the intersection of technology and social impact. Always, I am interested in basketball, soul music, and ice cream.</p>
            <p>If you need a developer or a product manager or if you want to make weird art, <a href="/">hit me up</a>. Check out my <a href="/work">previous work</a> to see what I can do. Or better yet, help me cross things off my <a href="/wantstodostuff">bucket list</a>.</p>
