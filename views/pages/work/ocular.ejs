        <p>Exploring our intimate — and sometimes uncomfortable — connection to sound and the gaze, Ocular is an instrument that loops and affects samples by tracking the performer's pupil using computer vision. Designed and developed over a span of three
            months, Ocular was performed in front of a live audience in Brooklyn, NY for ITP NIME on December 3, 2017.</p>
        <p>Created using Arduino, Adafruit Neopixels, MPU-6050 accel/gyro sensor. Special thanks to Danny Rozin.</p>
        <p>Created using Max MSP, Jitter, cv.Jit, and Arduino. Special thanks to Aaron Montoya Moraga, Greg Shakar, and the rest of the ITP NIME community.</p>
        <p>The max patch for this project is open source and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jpark11/Ocular">Github</a></p>
