                <p>Responsibly.me is a web platform for consumers to make more socially responsible purchasing decisions. Responsibly.me aggregates existing rankings on a company’s Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives and recommends similar products from brands with higher grades. Responsibly.me also provides a dashboard for users to understand their social responsibility values and purchasing habits in order to encourage them to shop more consciously.</p>

                <p>In this current climate where we face a growing number of wicked problems, both the public and private sector need to do more to create a better world for all of us. According to the 2017 Cone Communications CSR study, 63% of Americans are hopeful businesses will take the lead to drive social and environmental change moving forward. This number increases to 71% for millennials and younger generations. But are these companies doing enough?</p>
                <p>Companies have instituted CSR initiatives for some time now, but they have largely been in the service of raising the value of their corporate brand. Third-party organizations like the Corporate Knights and Greenpeace analyze and grade these CSR efforts, and yet only 39% of consumers “researched a company’s business practices or support of social and environmental issues” (2017 Cone Communications CSR study). The majority of users simply are not aware of the efforts corporations take to tackle these social issues. Given that around 90% of consumers say they would trust a company more if that company supports a social/environmental cause, why aren’t companies doing more to get the word out there on their efforts?</p>
                <p>Responsibly.me aims to make these efforts more transparent and easier to access for regular consumers. I have collected data on 50 of the top 100 brands according to Forbes and have built a web extension in which users can learn about a brand’s social responsibility rankings. I have also created design wireframes for product recommendations and the user dashboard to get an idea of where I hope to take this project.</p>

                <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-text">
                <p>Before ITP, I spent 5 years as a Product Marketer for a software company in Silicon Valley. I didn’t have anything against the company, but during my time in Silicon Valley, I began to see flaws in the system that I was deeply unhappy with. Companies were eager to market themselves as revolutionary companies changing the world for the better, but as I spent more time in Silicon Valley, I began to see that these benefits did not range beyond the privileged bubble of Silicon Valley. For all of its innovation and great work, Silicon Valley experienced gentrification, income inequality, and other social problems.</p>
                <p>On top of benefiting a select few, the tech industry seemed to be wasting a lot of resources. For example, it was common to pour tens of thousands of dollars into a marketing campaign. But it was also common for a successful campaign, on average, to convert around 2% of its audience. Conversion rates of 5% are good, and conversions of 10% or more are excellent. We rarely found campaigns that increased our ROI over 10%. If failing 9 out of 10 times is considered excellent, I figured there were probably better ways to fail that could actually change the world.</p>
                <p>I still believed in technology though, and I was looking for a creative outlet after my last job, so I came to ITP. While accidentally burning Arduinos for a Physical Computing project or creating your own instruments for NIME was a lot of fun, I tried to spend time at ITP finding impactful real-world applications for technology. Last spring, I worked for the NYC Mayor’s Office of Economic Opportunity where we designed web experiences for New York City residents to learn more about public programs and benefits eligibility. This past fall, I was a research fellow at NYU-X, an innovation lab at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing dedicated to the exploration of emerging technologies to promote innovative health care. At NYU-X, I designed and prototyped a smart-dresser system for caretakers of patients with early-onset dementia. These experiences pushed me to continue to explore innovative ways to design experiences to use technologies for larger social impact.</p>
                <p>I hope that Responsibly.me creates some competition between corporations to improve their Corporate Social Responsibility programs, align themselves with environmental and social issues, and help make this world a better place.</p>

                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-text">
                <p>My initial target audience for Responsibly.me is socially-conscious millennial online shoppers. Millennials make up the most active consumer demographic, and according to a business insider study, millennials spend the most money online, despite having lower income levels than older adults.</p>
                <p>According to the Nielsen Global Corporate Sustainability Report, 73% of millennials surveyed were willing to spend more on a product if it came from a sustainable brand. Millennials are changing our understanding of the interplay between consumer behavior and social responsibility. They advocate for transparent, moral, and sustainable business practices, and they are interested in securing a livable world for all of us. Hence, they are the perfect audience for which to design Responsibly.me.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-text">
                <p>So far, I have user-tested my platform with industry experts as well as fellow ITPers. Things I’ve learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A lot of people like the idea and can see the value it can have in the space. This was especially encouraging coming from those in the social impact space. </li>
                    <li>Users don’t need a lot of credibility. They just need a box to check off that lets them know that their choice is good. Give them that option and let them go down the rabbit hole if they want. </li>
                    <li>Users want to participate. They want to see how they are doing. How can we keep shoppers engaged? </li>
                    <li>Users like the Chrome Extension experience. Continue to make it as non-intrusive as possible. </li>
                    <li>Users want to get to the products that do good. Explore gamifying this action. </li>
                    <li>Stats don’t mean much to some people, but mean a lot to others. Information means more. Explore making the stats engaging and real for users. But leave an option for users to go down rabbit holes to find the data they are interested in.</li>
                    <li>Competitor information is the most relevant for users. Low scores are particularly influential.</li>

            <div class="portfolio-text">
                <p>DoneGood is a company that searches thousands of products across hundreds of mission-driven companies and offers discounts to recommended items. They also function as a Chrome Extension, but they do not tell you about a company’s social responsibility efforts.</p>
                <p>GoodGuide provides consumers with the information they need to make better shopping decisions. They analyze product ingredients and rank products based on health and safety. They used to do more work around social and environmental impact but have scaled back these efforts.</p>
                <p>Environmental Working Group is a non-partisan non-profit organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment. They publish research and consumer guides to help consumers choose healthier products.</p>
                <p>Amazon Smile donates 0.5% of the purchase price of eligible products to the charitable organization of your choice. Beyond this difference, the experience is very much like your ordinary Amazon experience.</p>
                <p>B-Corps is a certification that for-profit companies can acquire by meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.</p>

                <h3>Obstacles</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-text">
                <p>Due to my previous experience in marketing, I initially sought to create a set of marketing campaigns that would use recently available technologies to align a brand’s values with a cause that made sense for them. However, I did not want to greenwash and brands were already hesitant towards those campaigns that have fallen flat (i.e. Burger King and Net Neutrality, Dodge Trucks and Martin Luther King Jr., etc.)</p>
                <p>Thus I pivoted to my current idea. The biggest obstacle has been obtaining data. Datasets have been largely private which means that they are expensive and lack transparency. For this initial proof of concept, I worked with data that was publicly available, and if I take this project further, I hope to seek funding in order to obtain datasets.</p>
                <p>On the technical side, I had never built a web app of this scale before nor have I built a Chrome Extension. In addition to learning how to build an extension, I had to learn how to develop using React.js and MongoDB.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-title">
                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-text">
                <p>Responsibly.me will aim to track consumer behavior data for both individuals and for corporations. For a Chrome Extension, we can track how many people have downloaded the extension and basic demographic data. We can add cookies to links within our page in order to track users’ clicking behavior to get a sense of their purchasing decisions. We can compile this information into a consumer dashboard (see next steps) that can add value back to users, and we can also use this information to inform corporations on specific steps they can take to improve their CSR rankings and improve their customer funnel. For example, I can go to a company like Nike and let them know that they lost X% of customers that fit Y demographic to Adidas because they lack Z initiatives that are important to them. Using this data, we can create an actionable plan on what a company can do to improve their CSR initiatives to win back customers and improve their bottom line.</p>
                <p>For next iterations of Responsibly.me, I wish to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Build a recommendation engine for similar products from companies with better Responsibly scores.</li>
                    <li>Expand data collection for both companies and users. I want to collect information on more brands and demand transparency from the brands I currently have.</li>
                    <li>Create a dashboard for users to understand their values on sustainability, environmental health, fairness in the workplace and more, based on their shopping habits. Responsibly.me can find out the issues they care about and suggest non-profits and organizations to which they can donate. The platform can push content that is relevant and important to their values in order to keep them engaged and conscious of how their actions impact the bigger picture of social responsibility. We can begin to reward users for the positive actions they take, and users can feel empowered and informed of all the ways in which they are helping to make the world a better place.</li>
