                <p>Deliverance is a story about embracing one's past, no matter how painful. This four minute animated film transports its viewers to an immersive fantasy of sound, movement, and color. Motion-captured dancers animate a figure and her trails as they tell a story of being trapped by the scars of one's past. Only when our hero stops fighting these trails and accepts her fate does she finally find release.</p>
                <p>In collaboration with Danni Huang and Yasmin Schomann, this piece was designed specifically for a 150' x 11' screen in the lobby of the IAC Headquarters in New York City. </p>

                    Danni and I spent the summer brainstorming different concepts that we would like to tackle in our animated short. Once the semester began, we narrowed down our list to a concept we liked, and we began to quickly prototype a storyboard. The challenge with this project was to have a storyboard that would utilize all of the opportunities that a 150ft wide screen would offer us. So we compiled some quick sketches and tested images on the big screen in order to learn what colors, textures, and effects looked good on the big screen.

                    While we tested the visuals, we worked with Yasmin Schomann to craft a dance routine that would tell our story. We knew that animation would be difficult, so we wanted to use motion capture to tell our story and dance felt like the best way to do this in a beautiful and aesthetic way.
