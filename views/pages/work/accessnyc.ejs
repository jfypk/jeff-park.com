                <p>AccessNYC is an online public screening tool developed by the New York City Mayor's Office of Economic Opportunity and launched in March 2017. It is designed to help New York City residents determine the City, State, and Federal health and human service benefit programs for which they are potentially eligible to enroll.</p>
                <p>In the Spring of 2017, I joined the team as a product and design apprentice to help conduct user tests with city programs leaders, foster youths, and other NYC residents and synthesize this research into product improvements for AccessNYC's launch.</p>
